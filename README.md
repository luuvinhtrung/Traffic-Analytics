An urban traffic average speed forecast of short-term using regression methods

Nowadays, the application of statistical analysis to urban traffic data has been essential for advance traffic management and control. Congestion prediction is among the purposes of this application to cut down driving time, fuel consumption and pollution. Accordingly, we implement short-term average speed forecast for network sections using historical and real time speed data that recorded by vehicle attached devices. In order to build our predictive model, regression methods such as Lasso, Ridge, OLS (linear), Polynomial (non-linear integration), Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (ensemble) have been adopted. Their performances are correspondingly evaluated based on prediction accuracy and R-squared. We aim at providing a prediction solution that effectively works on recorded vehicle speed, regardless of other missing information of density, topography, section heading,â€¦
